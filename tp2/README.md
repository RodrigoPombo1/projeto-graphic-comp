## TP 2 Notes

- In exercise 2.3 we observed that the lighting is "messed up" and that it has to do with normal vectors, but we assume we are going to learn how to fix it in TP3 - Lighting and Materials.

- In exercise 3.4 and 3.5 we noticed that when we made both figures go in the same coordinates, they would "collide" with each other and the graphics became "messed up". So we separated them by making it so that the Tangram also translates 0.1 up.
